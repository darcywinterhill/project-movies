Project week 12 of Technigo bootcamp

# Project Movies
This was a pair programming project.
The goal for this week was to use a moviedatabase API to fetch a list of movies , display them on a page, and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie.

## The project
The task was also to make our site as close as possible to a finished design so we started by trying to figure out how to structure our site.
We made a component in which me made a fetch and then a map list all of the movies. We passed the props from the MovieList into a MovieCard component so it
would be eaiser to style. Each moviecard is a link to details-page with more information about that movie. To get that extra info we did a new fetch in MovieDetails.

All the links and pages were created by using react router.

We also made the site responsive.
